**how to play**  
download the files and put them in a folder called: terminal game  
inside this folder create a new folder: Sources, put the main.swift in this folder  

open a terminal and make sure you are in the terminal game folder,  
now type: swift run "terminal game" "type your name (without "")" "how many times to play (without "") in numbers bv. 2"  
now you are ready to go!  

I'm working on making this process easier  
# right now you can download the release(a .zip file), there is a troubleshoot in de main branch  
# you still have to 'cd' into the downloaded(unzipped) file
