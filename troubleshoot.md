## fix
in the directory from the file you just downloaded probably called terminal game, (to go here lets assume its downloaded in the file downloads,  
type: cd downloads/"terminal game" then enter.  
then type: swift package clean  
and it should work.

### other fixes
other fixes might be:  

Delete the module cache to ensure Swift rebuilds it fresh:  
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData  

rebuild it:  
swift build
